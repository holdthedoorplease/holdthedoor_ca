Express Entry System
======================

**Overview**

The Express Entry system is Canada's primary method for managing applications for permanent residence from skilled workers. It encompasses three federal economic immigration programs:

- **Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP)**: For individuals with foreign work experience in skilled occupations.
- **Federal Skilled Trades Program (FSTP)**: For qualified tradespersons with job offers or certifications in Canada.
- **Canadian Experience Class (CEC)**: For individuals with Canadian work experience in skilled occupations.

**Application Process**

1. **Determine Eligibility**: Assess qualifications based on factors such as age, education, work experience, and language proficiency.
2. **Create an Express Entry Profile**: Submit a profile to the Express Entry pool, where candidates are ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS).
3. **Receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA)**: Candidates with the highest CRS scores receive ITAs during regular draws.
4. **Submit Permanent Residence Application**: After receiving an ITA, submit a complete application within 60 days.

**Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)**

The CRS awards points based on:

- **Core Human Capital Factors**: Age, education, language proficiency, and work experience.
- **Skill Transferability Factors**: Combination of education and work experience.
- **Additional Factors**: Provincial nomination, job offer, Canadian education, and sibling in Canada.

A provincial nomination adds 600 points to a candidate's CRS score, effectively guaranteeing an ITA.

**Processing Times**

Express Entry applications are typically processed within six months.

Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)

2. **Apply for Nomination**: Submit an application to the province's immigration program.
3. **Receive Provincial Nomination**: If nominated, receive a certificate to include in your federal application.
4. **Apply for Permanent Residence**: Submit a federal application to IRCC, including the provincial nomination.

**Express Entry-Linked Streams**

Many provinces have Express Entry-aligned streams, allowing candidates to enter the Express Entry pool and receive an additional 600 CRS points upon nomination.
