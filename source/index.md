## Visit Canada: Temporary Resident Visa

Most foreigners need a visitor visa to enter Canada, whether you're coming to travel, study, work, or visit family. Usually, visitors are allowed to stay up to 6 months unless you're entering to study or work. If you wish to stay longer, leave and re-enter, or apply for an extension, additional steps are required.

```{admonition} To U.S. Citizens/PR
:class: note
Congratulations! If you hold a valid U.S. passport or Green Card, you don't need to apply for a Canadian visa beforehand. You can legally stay in Canada for up to 6 months to travel, look for work, or participate in short-term study programs unless you are inadmissible for medical reasons or criminal records. However, please note that you cannot engage in work or long-term studies unless you obtain the appropriate visa. [Read more](visitor/us/index)

## Immigration to Canada: Permanent Resident Visa

Canada welcomes immigrants under several main categories: Economic Class, Family Sponsorship, Refugees, and other reasons such as Humanitarian & Compassionate. Each category reflects Canada's commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

```{admonition} To U.S. Citizens/PR
:class: note
Sorry, being a U.S. citizen or PR doesn't automatically qualify you for Canadian PRâ€”you'll need to apply for it. If you've never worked in Canada, consider the Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSW). And if you're good at French, that's a real plus! Yes, French is also an official language in Canada. On the other hand, the Family Sponsorship is more straightforward: if you're married to or have been cohabiting with a Canadian/PR for more than a year, you might eligible for PR. There is also a common form of immigration known as a refugee claim. Unfortunately, being dissatisfied with election results of the U.S. does not count. [Read more](immigration/us/index)

Nope, having an American passport doesn't give you any shortcuts to Canadian citizenship. You've got to earn it like everyone else.
