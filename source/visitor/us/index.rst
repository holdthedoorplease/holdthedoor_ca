Visiting Canada
===========================

**Entry Requirements**

- **U.S. Citizens**: Do not require a visa or Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) for visits up to 180 days. A valid U.S. passport is necessary. (See `IRCC's entry requirements page <https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1116&top=16>`_)

**Duration of Stay**

Visitors can stay in Canada for up to six months. Extensions are possible but require an application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

**Customs and Declarations**

Travelers must declare all goods upon entry. Certain items may be restricted or prohibited. (See `Government of Canada's customs page <https://travel.gc.ca/returning/customs/entering-canada>`_)

**Health Insurance**

It's advisable to have travel health insurance, as U.S. health insurance may not cover services in Canada.

U.S. citizens and permanent residents must obtain a study permit for programs longer than six months. (See `Study permit details <https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada.html>`_)

2. **Work Permit Application**: Apply to IRCC with the necessary documents, including the job offer and, if applicable, a positive LMIA.

**Open Work Permits**

Certain individuals, such as spouses of skilled workers or international students, may be eligible for open work permits, allowing them to work for any employer in Canada.

**Permanent Residency Pathways**

Gaining Canadian work experience can enhance eligibility for permanent residency programs like the Canadian Experience Class under Express Entry.
